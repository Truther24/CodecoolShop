# CodecoolShop
CodecoolShop is an online store where you can purchase electronic products. You need to register & log in to add them to your cart, and you can change the product quantity before checking out. This is the first project built using the MVC design pattern, in ASP.NET C# with Razor pages.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone or download the repository and open the solution file in your IDE. You can then build and run the project from within the IDE.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the bin folder and run the CodecoolShop.exe file directly from the command line.

# Features
CodecoolShop includes the following features:

### Product catalog:
View the products available in the shop, along with their name, price, and image.
### Shopping cart: 
Add products to your cart and view the total cost of your order.
### Checkout: 
Enter your shipping and payment details and place your order.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into several folders, each representing a different component of the MVC pattern. These include:

### Models:
Contains the classes that represent the data of the application, such as Product and Order.
### Views:
Contains the templates that define the user interface of the application, written in HTML and Razor syntax.
### Controllers: 
Contains the classes that handle user requests and control the flow of the application.
### Services:
Contains the classes that implement the business logic of the application, such as ProductService and OrderService.
### Data:
