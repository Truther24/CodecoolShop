# CodecoolShop
CodecoolShop is an online store where you can purchase electronic products. You need to register & log in to add them to your cart, and you can change the product quantity before checking out. This is the first project built using the MVC design pattern, in ASP.NET C# with Razor pages.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, simply clone or download the repository and open the solution file in your IDE. You can then build and run the project from within the IDE.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the bin folder and run the CodecoolShop.exe file directly from the command line.
